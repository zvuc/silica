A new admin panel skin for Textcube. 

The goal is to completely replace the legacy skin CSS code and build a clean, modern and usable skin for the Textcube admin panel.

Currently work in progress: base framing, post list, editor pages are done. Other pages such as settings, plugins and deeper pages have yet to be coded.
