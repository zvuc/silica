A new admin dashboard skin for Textcube. 

The goal is to completely replace the legacy skin CSS code and build a clean, modern and usable skin for the Textcube admin panel.

Currently work in progress: base framing, post list, editor pages are done. Other pages such as settings, plugins and deeper pages have yet to be coded.

Always updated to work on the latest dev build of textcube.
(Current: 1.10.8)
